@article{Razavi2021,
   abstract = {Most integrated circuits incorporate bandgap references (often simply called bandgaps) to define certain dc voltages or currents that serve various building blocks. In this article, we introduce a step-by-step procedure for the design of low-voltage band-gaps. As presented in Figure 1, a typical power-management environment employs a low-dropout (LDO) circuit that, from a global supply of 1.2 V, generates a moderately regulated voltage around 1 V. This voltage acts as a local supply for the bandgap circuit and some other building blocks. It is desirable for the bandgap to provide substantial supply rejection to minimize corruption in its output due to the electronic noise produced by the LDO and the transient perturbations caused by the switching activities within the other building blocks. We target the following specifications: ■ output voltage = 0.5 V ■ output voltage variation 1 5 mV from 0 C c to 100 C c ■ supply rejection 2 40 dB ■ power consumption 1 1 mW ■ supply voltage %. 1 5 V ! = We design the circuit in 28-nm CMOS technology. The reader is referred to [1]-[12] for background information. Basic Operation We wish to generate a voltage that is nominally independent of the temperature. This can be accomplished by summing two voltages that have opposite temperature coefficients (TCs), as practiced in [1], [3], and [11]. Alternatively, we can first sum two currents of opposite TCs and then allow the result to flow through a resistor [9]. We pursue the latter here. The bandgap core is typically realized as illustrated in Figure 2(a), where the emitter areas of Q1 and Q2 differ by a factor of n, and amplifier A1 adjusts the gate voltage of M1 and M2 to equalize VX and. VY We thus obtain | | V V I R D2 1 1 2 BE BE = +. (1) Hence, | | , ln ln V I I V I I I R T S D T S D D 1 1 2 2 2 1 = + (2) where IS1 and IS2 denote the emit-ter saturation currents of Q1 and , Q2 respectively. Viewing Q1 as a unit and Q2 as n units in parallel, we have I nI S S 2 1 = and | | , ln I R V n D T 2 1= (3) where M1 and M2 are assumed to be identical. The voltage across R1 is therefore proportional to the absolute temperature (PTAT) and so are the drain currents of M1 and M2 if R1 has a zero TC. It is possible to make ID1 and ID2 independent of the temperature by attaching two resistors from X and Y to the ground [see Figure 2(b)] [9]. Let us formulate the circuit's behavior, assuming that.

   abstract = {The current flowing in a semiconductor junction may be divided into four components according to the location of the recombination and generation of electrons and holes. These are: 1) the bulk recombination-generation or the diffusion current, 2) the bulk recombination-generation current in the transition region, 3) the surface recombination-generation current in the transition region, and 4) the surface channel current. The current-voltage relationship for these four current components may be approximated by I = Is exp (qV/mkT), if V > 4kT/q. Analysis shows that the reciprocal slope m for the current components 1) to 3) lies between 1 and 2, while for the surface channel current component 4) m is greater than 2 for silicon junctions and may be more than 4 for large channels. The theoretical expressions for these four current components are tested with extensive experimental data taken on silicon junctions and found to account for all of the observed current-voltage characteristics. The importance of surface recombinations and surface channels on the current gain of silicon transistor is also demonstrated experimentally. The experimental data are in accord with the theoretical prediction based on the transistor current equations which include the carrier recombination in the emitter junction and the carrier generation in the collector junction.

   abstract = {For certain p-n junctions, it has been observed that the measured current-voltage characteristics deviate from the ideal case of the diffusion model. It is the purpose of this paper to show that the current due to generation and recombination of carriers from generation-recombination centers in the space charge region of a p-n junction accounts for the observed characteristics. This phenomenon dominates in semiconductors with large energy gap, low lifetimes, and low resistivity. This model not only accounts for the nonsaturable reverse current, but also predicts an apparent exp (qV/nkT) dependence of the forward current in a p-n junction. The relative importance of the diffusion current outside the space charge layer and the recombination current inside the space charge layer also explains the increase of the emitter efficiency of silicon transistors with emitter current. A correlation of the theory with experiment indicates that the energy level of the centers is a few kT from the intrinsic Fermi level. Copyright: © 1957, by the Institute of Radio Engineers, Inc.},

Using a first-order model of the energy and delay of a CMOS circuit, we show that lowering the supply and threshold voltage is generally advantageous, especially when the transistors are velocity saturated and the nodes have a high activity factor. In fact, for modern submicron technologies, this simple analysis suggests optimal energy efficiency at supply voltages under 0.5 V. Other process and circuit parameters have almost no effect on this optimal operating point. If there is some uncertainty in the value of the threshold or supply voltage, however, the power advantage of this very low voltage operation diminishes. Therefore, unless active feedback is used to control the uncertainty, in the future the supply and threshold voltage will not decrease drastically, but rather will continue to scale down to maintain constant electric fields.},

   abstract = {<p>In the modern theory of metallic conduction initiated by Bloch, conductors, semi-conductors, and non-conducting crystals may be represented by the same model. In this model each electron is supposed to move freely in the periodic field of the lattice. Owing to this field, not all electronic energy levels are allowed; the allowed levels are grouped into bands, separated by energy intervals which are disallowed. If all the energy levels of a given band are occupied by electrons, then, according to the theory, these electrons can make no contribution to an electric current in the crystal. If all the bands are full, the crystal must be an insulator. Thus in an insulator there exist a number of energy bands which are completely full, and a number of bands of higher energy which, for a perfect crystal at the absolute zero of temperature, are empty. In a real non-conducting crystal, however, there will be a few electrons in the first unfilled band, owing to thermal excitation, impurities, etc. Their number is, however, too small to give an appreciable current at ordinary field strengths. As the field strength is increased, the current due to these few electrons increases steadily, but it will not show the sudden rise observed in dielectric breakdown. For this sudden rise it is necessary that the number of electrons in an unfilled band should suddenly increase as the field strength passes a critical value. Two distinct mechanisms have been suggested for this sudden increase. Of these, the first is a process analogous to the electrical breakdown of gases. In the absence of an external field, the few electrons in the upper band are in the lowest energy state of this band; under the action of an electric field, they are raised to higher levels. When one of these electrons reaches a sufficiently high level, it will give up energy to an electron in a lower (full) band, both electrons making a transition to a low level of the upper band. The process will then be repeated; the number of electrons in the upper band will thus increase exponentially with time as long as the electric field is maintained.</p>},

Frequency-dependent voltage noise was studied with a very low-frequency spectrum analyzer, and was found to be the major factor limiting short-term stability to about one part in 108. For two of the three reference standards tested, humidity effects were the principal factors limiting the medium- and long-term stability of the 1.018 V outputs. These effects were studied by subjecting the standards to step-function changes in relative humidity. For example, increases in ambient relative humidity of 0.01 were found to provoke decreases of 0.05–0.15 µV in the 1.018 V output of one Zener. The time lag between the humidity change and the voltage change is characterized by a time constant ≥ 19 days. © 1995 IEEE},

@article{Kuijk1973,
   abstract = {A&sfracf-With increasing temperature the base-emitter voltage of a transistor with a constant current decreases, while the difference in base-emitter voltages of two identical (integrated) transistors having a constant current ratio increases. From the sum of the two voltages a nearly temperature-independent output voltage is obtained if this sum equals the gap voltage of silicon. A reference voltage source of 10 V based on this principle is described. The reference part of the circuit is an integrated circuit, and thin-film resistors with a small relative temperature coefficient are used. An operational amplifier and a few resistors and capacitors complete the circuit. The source has a parabolic temperature characteristic and the temperature peak can be controlled by resistor adjustment. A change of + 10 K in respect to the peak temperature causes an output voltage change of-250 LV, while a change of + 30 K causes a chsrrge of-2.2 mV. A long-term stability of 10 ppm/ month was measured. The circuit can compete with the best available Zener diode sources, and has the added advantage that practically no selection is necessary.},

   abstract = {This paper proposes a CMOS band-gap reference (BGR) circuit, which can successfully operate with sub-1V. In the conventional BGR circuit, the output voltage, Vref, is the sum of the built-in voltage of the diode, Vf, and the thermal voltage, VT, of kT/q multiplied by a constant. Thereby, Vref is about 1.25 V, which limits a low Vcc operation below 1V. Conversely, in the proposed BGR circuit, Vref has been converted from the sum of two currents; one is proportional to Vf, and the other is proportional to VT. An experimental BGR circuit, which is simply composed of a CMOS opamp, diodes, and resistors, has been fabricated in a conventional double metal 0.4 μm Flash memory process. Measured Vref is 515 mV±5 mV (3σ) for 23 samples on the same wafer at 27 °C through 125 °C.},
